# MovieLens100k - Based Personalized Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a personalized movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques, primarily leveraging matrix factorization via **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** from the [`Surprise`](http://surpriselib.com/) library. 

Built on the **MovieLens dataset**, this system predicts how a user might rate unseen movies based on their past preferences and recommends the top N movies accordingly.

It also includes detailed data preprocessing, model evaluation using cross-validation, and clustering of preferences to help understand and improve recommendations.

The design is modular, with clean separation between data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation components.

## Objectives

- Build a **collaborative filtering-based recommendation engine**
- Evaluate model performance using **RMSE** and **MAE**
- Predict user ratings for unseen movies
- Provide **top-N personalized recommendations**
- Evaluate model performance using **RMSE** and **MAE**
- Use clean code practices with modular structure for scalability

## Features

- üì• Load and preprocess the MovieLens dataset
- ‚öôÔ∏è Format data for use with the Surprise library
- üìä Perform 3-fold and 5-fold cross-validation
- üîç Display top-rated movies by the user
- üéØ Generate high-confidence movie recommendations
- üß† Modular structure: easy to extend, debug, or scale

## Evaluation Metrics

The recommendation engine is evaluated using:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **RMSE** | Root Mean Squared Error ‚Äî penalizes large prediction errors more harshly |
| **MAE** | Mean Absolute Error ‚Äî average absolute difference between predicted and actual ratings |

Both metrics are computed using **k-fold cross-validation** (3-fold and 5-fold).
